# Tarantella Package Manager ðŸ’ƒðŸ•·

Tarantella is an **incoming** modern package manager for C/C++ WASM apps (main modules) and WASM libraries (side modules) meant to be dynamically linked!

## Why use Tarantella?

Tarantella makes it easy to start, build, test, and distribute WASM apps and libraries by serving as a wrapper around several fantastic tools.

To start your app, run `tapm new "<app_name>" [-s]` (the `-s` makes it a side module). This automatically creates a C (but easily convertible to C++) WASM app with:
    - an empty git repo,
    - a dependencies folder for all side modules meant to be dynamically linked,
    - a releases folder for all your upcoming releases,
    - a src folder with a starting `main.c` file,
    - a `.gitignore`,
    - a `Makefile` to ease compilation, and
    - a `Tarantella.toml` file that contains all of your project's pertinent info.

To build your app, run `tapm build`. This will use the created `Makefile` to create a new release in your build directory specified in the `Tarantella.toml` and `Makefile`. 

WASM main modules initialize with an `index.html` file. To test your main module on the browser, run `tapm run [-p <some_port_>]` â€” this will start a [`basic-http-server`](https://crates.io/crates/basic-http-server).

For publishing apps, Tarantella depends on GitHub. There are two options:
- If your repository already has a public remote origin hosted on GitHub: Tarantella will simply publish your releases there.
- If your repository does not have a remote origin, or has a private remote origin, or has a remote origin not hosted on GitHub: Tarantella will create a GitHub repository called `<app_name>_releases` and publish your releases there. 

To publish your app, run `tapm login` to login to GitHub, and `tapm publish` to create a new release. If you do not have a GitHub account, run: `tapm register` for more info on how to register for GitHub.

**Missing subcommands:**
    - `tapm add "<dependency_creator>/<dependency_name>[-<version>]"`: this will allow you to add dependencies to your project.

## Why not use [WAPM](https://wapm.io/)?

As of now, [WAPM](https://wapm.io/) only allows distributing `.wasm` modules. If your WASM app includes something like a JS library that goes alongside it, you are left having to distribute that separetly â€” that sort of thing can really add complexity to, for example, setting up a WASM app that has several dynamically linked libraries.

## Install

```
cargo install tarantella
```

## Usage

```
tapm 0.5.0
tapm is a modern package manager for C/C++ WASM apps.

USAGE:
    tapm <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build       Build your wasm app
    help        Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    login       Login to GitHub to publish your wasm app with Tarantella
    new         Create a new wasm app (e.g., tapm new "dancing_web" [-s])
    publish     Publish a new release of your wasm app to GitHub with Tarantella (if your code is private, your
                release will be published to a separate repo)
    register    Register to GitHub to publish your wasm app with Tarantella
    run         Start an HTTP server to test your main module
```

For more info on subcommands, run: `tapm <subcommand> --help`.
